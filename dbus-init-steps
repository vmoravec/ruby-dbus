Steps with dbus communication:
DBus.system_bus.service "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager"

0. Create the (singleton) db instance
	#THREADSAFE
		* is it needed to create it as a class singleton instance
		* it could be just a method call of a module to get the reference to the dbus
		* or it could by a lazily created by calling the service method, there is no need to access the the dbus object (I mean here the ruby object, not a created object of a particular dbus service)
		* there could be a specialized method to access the object
1. Call the dbus service
		* connect to unix socket
			-> parse the address
			-> create the unix socket
2. Get the object
		* introspect the object to get the methods mapped into it
3. Introspect the object
		* get defined the interface methods on the dbus object
